# HeightDex

HeightDex is a pokemon-inspired project that fetches data from the PokeAPI to dynamically compare sizes between pokemon and real-life people, animals and even yourself. If you've ever wanted to see if you're taller than Charizard, or wanted to understand just how gigantic Wailord is, or even compare a giraffe to Girafarig, this app can finally help you do that!
